# 📊 Student Performance Data Visualization

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on **visual exploration and analysis of student performance data** using Python. The objective is to transform raw educational data into **clear, insightful, and presentation-ready visualizations** that help understand patterns, trends, and factors affecting student outcomes.

The project emphasizes **visual storytelling**, best practices in data visualization, and a structured analytical workflow, making it ideal as a **minor project for GitHub, LinkedIn, and academic portfolios**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Visually explore student performance metrics
* Understand distributions of numerical features
* Compare performance across categorical groups
* Identify trends, correlations, and outliers
* Practice professional data visualization techniques

---

## 🗂 Dataset Information

* **Dataset Name:** Student Performance Dataset
* **File:** `StudentPerformance.csv`
* **Description:** Contains academic scores along with demographic and study-related attributes of students
* **Level:** Student-level records

> 📎 The dataset is used purely for educational and analytical purposes.

---

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries Used

* **Python**
* **Pandas** – data loading and manipulation
* **NumPy** – numerical operations
* **Matplotlib** – core plotting library
* **Seaborn** – advanced statistical visualizations
* **Jupyter Notebook** – interactive analysis environment

---

## 📈 Visualizations Included

The notebook contains a variety of **EDA and data analysis plots**, including:

* Histograms & KDE plots (distribution analysis)
* Count plots (categorical frequency)
* Bar plots (category vs performance comparison)
* Box plots & violin plots (spread and outliers)
* Scatter plots (relationship analysis)
* Line plots (trend analysis, where applicable)
* Correlation heatmaps
* Missing value visualizations

All plots are designed to be **clean, readable, and non-scrollable**, following best visualization practices.
